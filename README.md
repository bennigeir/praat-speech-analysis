# Praat Speech Analysis

The aim of this project is to extract paralinguistic information from speech segments.

In  order  to  create  a  data  set  that  covers  thevowel system of Icelandic,  first we created alist  of  minimal  pair  words  that  includes  allvowels (both monophthongs and diphthongs) in Iceland.

## Instructions 

Each person recorded the pronounciation of each icelandic word three times. The recordings were labelled with the person's first language and age.
The formants were extracted from the recordings using Praat: http://joeystanley.com/downloads/191002-formant_extraction.html
The formants were visualised using Python. Visualisations can be found in the repo.
Experiments were made by creating classifiers to try to both classify native icelandic speakers from non-native speakers, and to classify vowels using only icelandic speakers.
